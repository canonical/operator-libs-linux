"""Abstractions for stopping, starting and managing system services via systemd.

This library assumes that your charm is running on a platform that uses systemd. E.g.,
Centos 7 or later, Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) or later.

For the most part, we transparently provide an interface to a commonly used selection of
systemd commands, with a few shortcuts baked in. For example, service_pause and
service_resume with run the mask/unmask and enable/disable invocations.

Example usage:
```python
from systemd import *

# Start a service
if not service_running("mysql"):
    success = service_start("mysql")

# Attempt to reload a service, restarting if necessary
success = service_reload("nginx", restart_on_failure=True)

```
